# Pi Integration Guide

**By: Geoff Bremner**

This guide explains how to integrate Matt Pocock's skills into your pi coding agent instance.

## Prerequisites

You need to have pi installed and configured. See [pi documentation] (https://pi.dev/) for installation instructions.

## Installation (30-second setup)

Two ways in, two philosophies. **The [Claude Code plugin](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins)** installs the whole set as a managed, read-only bundle that updates when I ship — you subscribe rather than fork. **[skills.sh](https://skills.sh/mattpocock/skills)** copies editable skill files into your project, so you can hack on them and make them your own. Pick one — installing both leaves you with every skill twice.

### 1. Get the skills

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong></summary>

```bash
claude plugins install mattpocock-skills
```

Or, from inside a session:

```
/plugin install mattpocock-skills
```

It's in Claude Code's official marketplace, so there's nothing to add first, and updates arrive automatically.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Codex, and other agents</strong></summary>

```bash
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/geoffbremner/skills
```

Pick the skills you want, and which coding agents to install them on. **The installer lets you choose which skills to take — make sure `setup-matt-pocock-skills` is one of them.**

A native Codex plugin is on the roadmap — see [`.agents/adr/0002-ship-as-a-claude-code-plugin.md`](./.agents/adr/0002-ship-as-a-claude-code-plugin.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>For tinkerers</strong></summary>

Use the same installer, on any agent — including Claude Code:

```bash
npx skills@latest add mattpocock/skills
```

It writes the skills into your repo as ordinary files you own and can edit. Nothing updates behind your back; pull my latest changes when you want them with `npx skills update`.

</details>

### 2. Run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`

In your agent, run it once per repo. It will:

- Ask you which issue tracker you want to use (GitHub, Linear, or local files)
- Ask you what labels you apply to tickets when you triage them (`/triage` uses labels)
- Ask you where you want to save any docs we create

### 3. Bam - you're ready to go.

```bash
cd ~/Documents/skills
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mattpocock/skills.git
```

Manually check it:
```bash
git remote -v
```

If it's not working...
```bash
git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/mattpocock/skills.git
```

## Step 4: Configure Pi Settings

Create or edit the pi settings file at `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`.

**To create:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent
cat > ~/.pi/agent/settings.json << 'EOF'
{
  "skills": [
    "~/Documents/skills/skills/engineering",
    "~/Documents/skills/skills/productivity",
    "~/Documents/skills/skills/misc"
  ]
}
EOF
```

**To edit:**

```bash
vim ~/.pi/agent/settings.json
```

Add the `skills` array to your existing JSON:

```json
{
  "model": "your-existing-model",
  "skills": [
    "~/Documents/skills/skills/engineering",
    "~/Documents/skills/skills/productivity",
    "~/Documents/skills/skills/misc"
  ]
}
```

**Note:** We only include `engineering`, `productivity`, and `misc` directories. The `personal`, `in-progress`, and `deprecated` directories are intentionally excluded.

## Step 3: Add AGENTS.md

The agent configuration is split between two primary workflows:

1. **Obsidian Knowledge** — My workflow for maintaining knowledge, vault organization, and documentation. Inspired by Nick Milo.
2. **Software Engineering** — My workflow for code, debugging, and infrastructure. Inspired by Matt Pocock and Andrej Karpathy

Setup these instructions in your pi agent:

```bash
cp agents/AGENTS.md ~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md
cp agents/AGENTS_OBSIDIAN.md ~/.pi/agent/AGENTS_OBSIDIAN.md
cp agents/AGENTS_SOFTWARE.md ~/.pi/agent/AGENTS_SOFTWARE.md
```

This ensures that upon launch, you can specify if you are working on software, knowledge, or a hybrid of both.

## Step 4: Add the curl skill to read webpages:

```bash
pi install npm:@curl.md/pi
```

This allows you to paste URLs and pi will fetch them

## Step 5: Verify the Installation

Reload skills in pi:

```
/reload
```

Then verify skills are loaded by asking:

```
What skills do you have available?
```

## Model Compatibility

These skills work with **all models** supported by pi (Claude, GPT-4, local models, etc.). The configuration is model-agnostic.

## Updating Skills

To get Matt's latest updates:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/skills
git pull upstream main
git push origin main  # push to your fork
```

Then reload skills in pi:

For debugging, I've also built a **[`/diagnosing-bugs`](./skills/engineering/diagnosing-bugs/SKILL.md)** skill that wraps best debugging practices into a disciplined loop, gated phase by phase.

## Troubleshooting

### Skills not showing up?

> "The best modules are deep. They allow a lot of functionality to be accessed through a simple interface."
>
> John Ousterhout, [A Philosophy Of Software Design](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philosophy-Software-Design-2nd/dp/173210221X)

**The Problem**: Most apps built with agents are complex and hard to change. Because agents can radically speed up coding, they also accelerate software entropy. Codebases get more complex at an unprecedented rate.

**The Fix** for this is a radical new approach to AI-powered development: caring about the design of the code.

This is built in to every layer of these skills:

- [`/to-spec`](./skills/engineering/to-spec/SKILL.md) quizzes you about which modules you're touching before creating a spec

And crucially, [`/improve-codebase-architecture`](./skills/engineering/improve-codebase-architecture/SKILL.md) surveys a codebase for deepening opportunities and hands you the candidates. I recommend running it on your codebase once every few days. It is a survey, not a rescue: on a genuinely old codebase it will find real candidates, but it won't untangle the mud for you.

### Summary

Software engineering fundamentals matter more than ever. These skills are my best effort at condensing these fundamentals into repeatable practices, to help you ship the best apps of your career. Enjoy.

## Reference

These split on one axis — who can invoke them. **User-invoked** skills are reachable only when you type them (e.g. `/grill-me`); their job is to orchestrate. **Model-invoked** skills can be invoked by you _or_ reached for automatically by the agent when the task fits; they hold the reusable discipline. A user-invoked skill may invoke model-invoked skills, but never another user-invoked one.

### Engineering

Skills I use daily for code work.

**User-invoked**

- **[ask-matt](./skills/engineering/ask-matt/SKILL.md)** — Ask which skill or flow fits your situation. A router over the user-invoked skills in this repo.
- **[grill-with-docs](./skills/engineering/grill-with-docs/SKILL.md)** — Grilling session that also builds your project's domain model, sharpening terminology and updating `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs inline.
- **[triage](./skills/engineering/triage/SKILL.md)** — Move issues through a state machine of triage roles.
- **[improve-codebase-architecture](./skills/engineering/improve-codebase-architecture/SKILL.md)** — Scan a codebase for deepening opportunities, present them as a visual HTML report, then grill through whichever one you pick.
- **[setup-matt-pocock-skills](./skills/engineering/setup-matt-pocock-skills/SKILL.md)** — Configure this repo for the engineering skills (issue tracker, triage labels, domain doc layout). Run once per repo before using the other engineering skills.
- **[to-spec](./skills/engineering/to-spec/SKILL.md)** — Turn the current conversation into a spec and publish it to the issue tracker. No interview — just synthesizes what you've already discussed.
- **[to-tickets](./skills/engineering/to-tickets/SKILL.md)** — Break any plan, spec, or conversation into a set of tracer-bullet tickets, each declaring its blocking edges — written as text in a local file, or as native blocking links on a real tracker.
- **[implement](./skills/engineering/implement/SKILL.md)** — Build the work described by a spec or set of tickets, driving `/tdd` at pre-agreed seams and closing out with `/code-review` before committing.
- **[wayfinder](./skills/engineering/wayfinder/SKILL.md)** — Plan a huge chunk of work, more than one agent session can hold, as a shared map of decision tickets on the issue tracker — resolve them one at a time until the way to the destination is clear.

**Model-invoked**

- **[prototype](./skills/engineering/prototype/SKILL.md)** — Build a throwaway prototype to answer a design question — a single shareable HTML file for state/logic questions, or several radically different UI variations toggleable from one route.
- **[diagnosing-bugs](./skills/engineering/diagnosing-bugs/SKILL.md)** — Disciplined diagnosis loop for hard bugs and performance regressions: build a feedback loop that goes red on this bug → minimise → hypothesise → instrument → fix → regression-test.
- **[research](./skills/engineering/research/SKILL.md)** — Investigate a question against high-trust primary sources and capture the findings as a cited Markdown file in the repo, run as a background agent.
- **[tdd](./skills/engineering/tdd/SKILL.md)** — Test-driven development with a red-green-refactor loop. Builds features or fixes bugs one vertical slice at a time.
- **[domain-modeling](./skills/engineering/domain-modeling/SKILL.md)** — Actively build and sharpen a project's domain model — challenge terms against the glossary, stress-test with edge-case scenarios, and update `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs inline.
- **[codebase-design](./skills/engineering/codebase-design/SKILL.md)** — Shared discipline and vocabulary for designing deep modules: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface, placed at a clean seam, testable through that interface.
- **[code-review](./skills/engineering/code-review/SKILL.md)** — Two-axis review of the diff since a fixed point: **Standards** (does it follow the repo's coding standards, plus a Fowler smell baseline?) and **Spec** (does it faithfully implement the originating issue/spec?), run as parallel sub-agents so neither pollutes the other.
- **[resolving-merge-conflicts](./skills/engineering/resolving-merge-conflicts/SKILL.md)** — Work through an in-progress git merge or rebase conflict hunk by hunk, resolving by intent traced to each side's primary source, then finish the operation — never `--abort`.
- **[wizard](./skills/engineering/wizard/SKILL.md)** — Generate an interactive bash wizard that walks a human through steps only they can perform: provisioning infrastructure, setting up credentials or CI secrets, walking an unfamiliar third-party dashboard, or running a one-off migration or cutover.

### Productivity

General workflow tools, not code-specific.

**User-invoked**

- **[grill-me](./skills/productivity/grill-me/SKILL.md)** — Get relentlessly interviewed about a plan or design until every branch of the design tree is resolved.
- **[handoff](./skills/productivity/handoff/SKILL.md)** — Compact the current conversation into a handoff document so another agent can continue the work.
- **[teach](./skills/productivity/teach/SKILL.md)** — Teach the user a new skill or concept over multiple sessions, using the current directory as a stateful teaching workspace.
- **[to-questionnaire](./skills/productivity/to-questionnaire/SKILL.md)** — Turn a decision you can't answer alone into a Markdown questionnaire for the one person who can — filled in async, or together over a meeting. It grills you about the send (who it's for, what you need back), not the subject.
- **[wait-what](./skills/productivity/wait-what/SKILL.md)** — Fire this the moment a message doesn't land. The agent re-pitches it with the context you're missing, in plain English, using your `CONTEXT.md` vocabulary.

**Model-invoked**

- **[grilling](./skills/productivity/grilling/SKILL.md)** — Interview the user relentlessly about a plan, decision, or idea until every branch of the design tree is resolved. The reusable interview primitive behind `grill-me`, `grill-with-docs`, `triage`, `wayfinder` and `improve-codebase-architecture`.
- **[writing-for-agents](./skills/productivity/writing-for-agents/SKILL.md)** — Writing documents for agents: skills, AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, and any doc an agent reaches by a pointer.
